# React JS Workshop - Hands-on

## Setup

1. Clone this directory
2. cd into the project directory
3. run `npm install`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run api-server`

Launches the locally installed json-server, using `db.json` as its data store.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Code Snippets

Some things just aren't worth typing as a group, so we have a few snippets here so we can copy/paste and move on with our lives.
